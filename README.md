# PremierChoiceHoliday
A website I created for my First Year assignment. HTML5 and CSS was used to give it a nice look. I also used PHP for querying the holiday events from the database, and creating and inserting new events to the database.

The website can be accessed here: http://unn-w17018747.newnumyspace.co.uk/index.html
